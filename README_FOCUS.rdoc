=== Summary

Easily focus assertions

=== Examples

  require 'nanotest'
  require 'nanotest/focus'
  include  Nanotest

  assert("this test won't run") { false }

  focus
  assert { true }
  assert("this test won't run") { false }

  focus
  assert { true }

This will only run the two tests following the #focus calls, and the "suite"
will pass. Will also work across test files.
